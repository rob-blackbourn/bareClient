# Welcome

A simple asyncio http client.

## Description

This package provides the asyncio transport for
[h11](https://h11.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html),
and [h2](https://python-hyper.org/projects/h2/en/stable/).

It makes little attempt to provide any helpful features which might do
unnecessary work.

This client is part of a suite of lightweight HTTP tools around the
[bareASGI](https://github.com/rob-blackbourn/bareasgi) framework.
